# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in Linkr, we take it seriously. Please
follow the steps below to report it so we can respond quickly and responsibly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Do not file a public issue. Instead, contact the maintainers privately by
   opening a confidential issue on GitHub or emailing the address listed in the
   repository contact information.
2. Include a clear, concise description of the vulnerability and steps to
   reproduce it. Add any relevant environment details (OS, browser version,
   extension version).
3. If possible, include a minimal reproduction case.

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide an estimated timeline
for a fix.

## Supported Versions

We support the latest stable release of Linkr. Security fixes may be
backported to previous releases at the maintainers' discretion.

## Disclosure Policy

We will work with the reporter to coordinate a responsible disclosure. Public
disclosure will be postponed until a patch is released or an acceptable
mitigation is available.

## Contact

Open a confidential issue on GitHub or reach out to the repository maintainer
via the contact info in `README.md`.
