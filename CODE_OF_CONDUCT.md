# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of Linkr, we pledge to make participation in our
project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of
experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion,
or nationality.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant (v2.1).

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of
Conduct. Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or
permanently ban any contributor for behavior that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, or harmful.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by
opening a confidential issue on GitHub or contacting the maintainers via the
repository's Security & Privacy channels. When possible, include:

- The names (GitHub usernames) of those involved
- A description of the incident with date, time, and location (issue/PR/etc.)
- Any relevant screenshots or logs

Reports will be handled with discretion and with respect for privacy.

## Enforcement Process

1. A maintainer will acknowledge receipt of a report within 72 hours.
2. The report will be reviewed and investigated by one or more maintainers.
3. Remedial actions may include a private warning, removal of content, temporary
   or permanent ban from the repository, and/or referral to platform services
   (e.g., GitHub support) when necessary.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project (e.g., social media, chat
channels, and other online forums).
